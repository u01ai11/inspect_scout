### Frontend development (TypeScript)

The web UI lives in a git submodule and uses Git LFS for binary assets. **These steps are only needed if you plan to work on the TypeScript/React frontend** — Python-only contributors can skip this entirely.

1. [Install Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) and run `git lfs install`
2. Initialize the submodule and install dependencies — see the [one-time setup guide](src/inspect_scout/_view/ts-mono/docs/submodule-guide.md#one-time-setup)
